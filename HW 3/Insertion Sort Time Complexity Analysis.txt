Insertion Sort Time Complexity Analysis
Best Case Time Complexity:

In the best-case scenario, the input array is already sorted.
In each iteration of the outer loop, only one comparison is needed to determine the correct position for the current element.
The time complexity in the best case is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
Worst Case Time Complexity:

In the worst-case scenario, the input array is in reverse order.
In each iteration of the outer loop, the current element needs to be compared with all elements to its left until it reaches the correct position.
This results in approximately n/2 comparisons on average for each element.
The time complexity in the worst case is O(n^2).
Average Case Time Complexity:

In the average case, the input array is randomly ordered.
The average number of comparisons and swaps depends on the distribution of elements in the array.
On average, the number of comparisons and swaps is approximately proportional to n^2/4.
The time complexity in the average case is also O(n^2).
