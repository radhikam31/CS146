Anagram Problem Solution Approach
Problem Statement
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

High-Level Approach
To solve the anagram problem, we follow these steps:

Check lengths: If the lengths of strings s and t are not equal, they cannot be anagrams. Return false in this case.

Sort and Compare: Sort the characters of both strings and compare if the sorted versions are equal. If they are equal, then the strings are anagrams; otherwise, they are not.

Implementation Details
Java: In Java, we convert the strings to character arrays, sort the arrays, and then compare if they are equal.

Python: In Python, we use the sorted() function to sort the characters of the strings and then compare the sorted lists.

Example
For example, given the strings "anagram" and "nagaram", after sorting, both strings become "aaagmnr". Since the sorted versions are equal, "nagaram" is an anagram of "anagram".
