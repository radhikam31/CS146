High-Level Approach
To solve the first bad version problem, we follow these steps:

Binary Search: We use a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the first bad version.

Define Search Space: We define the search space as all possible versions, from 1 to n.

Check Middle Version: We check the middle version of the search space using the isBadVersion API.

Update Search Space: Based on the result of the API call, we update the search space to the left or right of the middle version, depending on whether the middle version is bad or not.

Repeat Until Found: We repeat steps 3 and 4 until we find the first bad version.

Implementation Details
Java: In Java, we implement the binary search algorithm and call the isBadVersion method to determine if a version is bad.

Python: In Python, we use a similar approach, implementing the binary search algorithm and calling the is_bad_version function.

Example
For example, suppose we have 5 versions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. If the first bad version is 4, the algorithm should return 4 as the first bad version.
