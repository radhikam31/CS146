# High-Level Approach for Determining Valid Binary Search Tree (BST)

## General Approach:
To determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST), we need to traverse the tree while maintaining the BST property:
- For each node, the left subtree should contain only nodes with values less than the node's value.
- The right subtree should contain only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
- This property should apply to all nodes and subtrees.

## Java Approach:
1. **Recursion:** We use a recursive approach to traverse the tree and check if each node satisfies the BST property.
2. **Valid Range:** For each node, we maintain a valid range within which its value should lie to maintain the BST property.
3. **Base Case:** If the node is null, it's a valid BST.
4. **Recursion:** For each node, we recursively check if its value is within the valid range, and if its left and right subtrees are also valid BSTs.

## Python Approach:
1. **Recursion:** Similar to the Java approach, we use recursion to traverse the tree and check the BST property for each node.
2. **Valid Range:** We maintain a valid range for each node's value, ensuring it falls within the acceptable range to maintain the BST property.
3. **Base Case:** If the node is None, it's a valid BST.
4. **Recursion:** For each node, we recursively check if its value is within the valid range, and if its left and right subtrees are also valid BSTs.
