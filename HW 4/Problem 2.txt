Problem 2: Matrix Multiplication Time Complexity Analysis
Matrix multiplication involves multiplying two matrices to produce a third matrix. Here's the breakdown of its time complexity:

Time Complexity:
The provided pseudocode uses three nested loops to iterate through the rows and columns of the matrices A and B.
Each element of the resulting matrix (result[i][j]) is computed by summing the products of corresponding elements of row i of matrix A and column j of matrix B.
Therefore, the time complexity of the matrix multiplication algorithm is O(rows_A * cols_A * cols_B), where rows_A is the number of rows in matrix A, cols_A is the number of columns in matrix A, and cols_B is the number of columns in matrix B.
