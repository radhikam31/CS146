Java Solution Approach:
To solve the level order traversal problem for a binary tree in Java, we utilize a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. Here's a high-level explanation of the approach:

Initialize Variables: We initialize an empty list to store the result of the level order traversal and a queue to perform BFS.
BFS: We enqueue the root node into the queue.
Traversal: While the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node from the queue and add its value to the current level's list. We also enqueue its left and right child nodes if they exist.
Repeat: We repeat the process until the queue is empty.
Return Result: We return the list containing the level order traversal.
This approach ensures that we traverse the binary tree level by level, from left to right, and store the nodes' values accordingly.

Python Solution Approach:
To solve the level order traversal problem for a binary tree in Python, we also utilize a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. Here's a high-level explanation of the approach:

Initialize Variables: We initialize an empty list to store the result of the level order traversal and a deque to perform BFS.
BFS: We append the root node into the deque.
Traversal: While the deque is not empty, we determine the size of the current level, iterate over it, and append the values of the nodes to the current level's list. We also append the left and right child nodes of each node to the deque if they exist.
Repeat: We repeat the process until the deque is empty.
Return Result: We return the list containing the level order traversal.
This approach, similar to the Java solution, ensures that we traverse the binary tree level by level, from left to right, and store the nodes' values accordingly.
