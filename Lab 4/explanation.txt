# High-Level Approach for Inverting a Binary Tree

## General Approach:
To invert a binary tree, we need to swap the left and right children of each node recursively.

## Java Approach:
1. **Base Case:** If the root is null, return null.
2. **Recursion:** Swap the left and right children of the current node recursively.
3. **Return:** Return the modified root.

## Python Approach:
1. **Base Case:** If the root is None, return None.
2. **Recursion:** Swap the left and right children of the current node recursively.
3. **Return:** Return the modified root.
